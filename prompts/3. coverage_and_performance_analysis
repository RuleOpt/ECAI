	For two given detection rules, perform a detailed comparative analysis:
        1. Coverage Analysis
        - Data Sources and Event Types:
            - Scope of Data Sources: Evaluate if the rule applies to various critical data sources (e.g., network logs, endpoint data, IAM, cloud sources),Score: 1 (limited to one source.) to 5 (multi-source, covering all critical data types).
            - Event Types Breadth: Determine if the rule captures multiple relevant event types (e.g., login attempts, file access, process execution), Score: 1 (single event type) to 5 (broad range of relevant events).
        - Behavioral Patterns and Context Awareness:
            - Behavioral Pattern Detection: Assess if the rule identifies behavioral patterns, such as anomalous access or unusual activity over time, Score: 1 (static detection) to 5 (dynamic pattern recognition).
            - Context Enrichment: Examine if the rule correlates or enriches data for added context (e.g., adding geolocation to IPs, mapping users to departments), Score: 1 (no enrichment) to 5 (highly enriched with relevant context).
        - Detection Scenario Scope:
            - Assess if the rule can detect a wide range of scenarios, increasing its applicability to various detection needs, Score: 1 (limited detection scenarios) to 5 (broadly applicable across scenarios).2. False Positive Analysis: Examine threshold logic, baseline methodology, filtering mechanisms, validation steps, context verification, and alert conditions.
        
	2. Performance Analysis: Assess search command efficiency, datamodel utilization, statistical operations, join complexity, and resource requirements.
        Evaluation Criteria:
            Coverage Winner: Rule showing broader detection scope, better context awareness, and comprehensive pattern detection
            Performance Winner: Rule with efficient search operations, optimized data handling, and lower computational overhead

        
	3. False Positive Analysis
        - Break Down and Understand Rule Conditions
            - Identify the specific conditions, filters, and events the rule targets. Understand how the rule determines a match (e.g., combination of event types, fields, or thresholds).
            - List the logs, providers, or command lines the rule monitors (e.g., process creation events, registry modifications, PowerShell scripts).
            - Understand whether the rule aims to detect specific malicious patterns, behaviors, or anomalous activities.
        - Evaluate Trade-offs
            - Narrowly scoped rules reduce noise but may overlook critical threats, creating blind spots. This trade-off is often risky in real-world scenarios.
            - Broad Coverage: Generalized rules can detect a wider range of threats but may generate more false positives. These must be carefully triaged and optimized.
        - Avoid Binary Thinking: Rules should neither be overly narrow nor excessively broad. Strive for a balance where precision and coverage are fine-tuned to minimize blind spots while keeping false positives manageable.
        
        Evaluation Criteria:
            False Positive Winner: Rule demonstrating superior threshold handling, validation logic, and precise alert conditions.
