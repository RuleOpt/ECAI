	For two given SIEM detection rules, perform a detailed comparative analysis:
        1. False Positive Analysis
        - Break Down and Understand Rule Conditions
            - Identify the specific conditions, filters, and events the rule targets. Understand how the rule determines a match (e.g., combination of event types, fields, or thresholds).
            - List the logs, providers, or command lines the rule monitors (e.g., process creation events, registry modifications, PowerShell scripts).
            - Understand whether the rule aims to detect specific malicious patterns, behaviors, or anomalous activities.
        - Evaluate Trade-offs
            - Narrowly scoped rules reduce noise but may overlook critical threats, creating blind spots. This trade-off is often risky in real-world scenarios.
            - Broad Coverage: Generalized rules can detect a wider range of threats but may generate more false positives. These must be carefully triaged and optimized.
        - Avoid Binary Thinking: Rules should neither be overly narrow nor excessively broad. Strive for a balance where precision and coverage are fine-tuned to minimize blind spots while keeping false positives manageable.
        
        Evaluation Criteria:
            False Positive Winner: Rule demonstrating superior threshold handling, validation logic, and precise alert conditions.
