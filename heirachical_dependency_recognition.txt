	You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in security rules for SIEM (Security Information and Event Management). Assume that the rules are being used in a production environment with a large volume of data.

	If the rules have different providers with no hierarchical relationship (e.g., Linux vs Windows or Azure vs GCP). Then Category is Independent.
        If the rule is related to diffrent applications and the progression in not towards generic(e.g., Azure AD vs. O365 ) they do not share hierarchical relationship and should be considered Independent .
        Examine the actions or outcomes specified in each rule. If the actions are different or the purpose of the rule (e.g., enabling vs. disabling) varies, it's a strong indicator that the rules have distinct scopes and Independent.
        If either rules show progression from specific to generic. Then Category is Dependent
        
        Refer the below two examples for more clarification
        Example 1:
        Rule 1: Abnormally High AWS Instances Terminated by User `cloudtrail` eventName=TerminateInstances errorCode=success | bucket span=10m _time | stats count AS instances_terminated by _time userName | eventstats avg(instances_terminated) as total_terminations_avg, stdev(instances_terminated) as total_terminations_stdev | eval threshold_value = 4 | eval isOutlier=if(instances_terminated > total_terminations_avg+(total_terminations_stdev * threshold_value), 1, 0) | search isOutlier=1 AND _time >= relative_time(now(), "-10m@m")| eval num_standard_deviations_away = round(abs(instances_terminated - total_terminations_avg) / total_terminations_stdev, 2) |table _time, userName, instances_terminated, num_standard_deviations_away, total_terminations_avg, total_terminations_stdev | `abnormally_high_aws_instances_terminated_by_user_filter`
        Rule 2: Abnormally High Number Of Cloud Instances Destroyed | tstats count as instances_destroyed values(All_Changes.object_id) as object_id from datamodel=Change where All_Changes.action=deleted AND All_Changes.status=success AND All_Changes.object_category=instance by All_Changes.user _time span=1h | `drop_dm_object_name("All_Changes")` | eval HourOfDay=strftime(_time, "%H") | eval HourOfDay=floor(HourOfDay/4)*4 | eval DayOfWeek=strftime(_time, "%w") | eval isWeekend=if(DayOfWeek >= 1 AND DayOfWeek <= 5, 0, 1) | join HourOfDay isWeekend [summary cloud_excessive_instances_destroyed_v1] | where cardinality >=16 | apply cloud_excessive_instances_destroyed_v1 threshold=0.005 | rename "IsOutlier(instances_destroyed)" as isOutlier | where isOutlier=1 | eval expected_upper_threshold = mvindex(split(mvindex(BoundaryRanges, -1), ":"), 0) | eval distance_from_threshold = instances_destroyed - expected_upper_threshold | table _time, user, instances_destroyed, expected_upper_threshold, distance_from_threshold, object_id | `abnormally_high_number_of_cloud_instances_destroyed_filter`
        Output: 
        { 
            "category": "Dependent", 
            "details": "Rule 1 is specific to AWS (TerminateInstances in CloudTrail) while Rule 2 shows progression to generic cloud providers (datamodel=Change for instance deletion), demonstrating evolution from specific to generic provider monitoring"
        }

        Example 2:
        Rule 1: GCP Kubernetes cluster scan detection `google_gcp_pubsub_message` data.protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerIp!=127.0.0.1 data.protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerIp!=::1 "data.labels.authorization.k8s.io/decision"=forbid "data.protoPayload.status.message"=PERMISSION_DENIED data.protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail="system:anonymous" | rename data.protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerIp as src_ip | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(data.protoPayload.methodName) as method_name values(data.protoPayload.resourceName) as resource_name values(data.protoPayload.requestMetadata.callerSuppliedUserAgent) as http_user_agent by src_ip data.resource.labels.cluster_name | rename data.resource.labels.cluster_name as cluster_name| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`  | `gcp_kubernetes_cluster_scan_detection_filter`
        Rule 2: Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster scan detection `aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks` "user.username"="system:anonymous" userAgent!="AWS Security Scanner" | rename sourceIPs\{\} as src_ip | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(responseStatus.reason) values(source) as cluster_name values(responseStatus.code) values(userAgent) as http_user_agent values(verb) values(requestURI) by src_ip user.username user.groups{} | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`amazon_eks_kubernetes_cluster_scan_detection_filter`
        {
            "category": "Independent",
            "details": "Rule 1 is specific to GCP Kubernetes (google_gcp_pubsub_message) while Rule 2 is specific to AWS EKS (aws_cloudwatchlogs_eks). These are different providers with no hierarchical relationship, monitoring their respective Kubernetes implementations"
        }

        Example 3:
        Rule 1:Permission Modification using Takeown App | tstats security_content_summariesonly count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name = "takeown.exe" Processes.process = "/6" by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid | drop_dm_object_name(Processes) | security_content_ctime(firstTime) | security_content_ctime(lastTime) | permission_modification_using_takeown_app_filter
        Rule 2: Modify ACL permission To Files Or Folder | tstats security_content_summariesonly values(Processes.process) as process values(Processes.process_id) as process_id count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process_name = "cacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "icacls.exe" OR Processes.process_name = "xcacls.exe") AND Processes.process = "/G" AND (Processes.process = "* everyone:" OR Processes.process = " SYSTEM:" OR Processes.process = " S-1-1-0:*") by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.dest Processes.user | drop_dm_object_name(Processes) | security_content_ctime(firstTime) | security_content_ctime(lastTime) | modify_acl_permission_to_files_or_folder_filter
        Output: 
        { 
            "category": "Independent",
            "details": "The rules are not similar because they involve different processes (takeown.exe vs cacls.exe, icacls.exe, xcacls.exe) and different permission modification patterns (specifically mentioning Everyone, SYSTEM, and built-in accounts vs a more general wildcard)"
